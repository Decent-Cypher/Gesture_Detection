# Hand Gesture Recognition Project

This project aims to recognize hand gestures using Python. It utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and interpret hand movements and gestures captured through a camera.

## Overview

Hand gesture recognition has applications in various fields such as human-computer interaction, sign language recognition, and virtual reality control. This project focuses on developing a Python-based system to accurately recognize and interpret hand gestures in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time hand detection and tracking using computer vision techniques.
- Recognition of predefined hand gestures such as thumbs up, peace sign, and waving.
- Support for training custom hand gestures using machine learning algorithms.
- Integration with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for user interaction.
